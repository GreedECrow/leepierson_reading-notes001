## Reading
## Learn HTML
## Creating Hyperlinks

### 1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
`<a></a>`

The web address the link leads too.

## CSS Layout
## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

### 1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
Elements lay out on a web page in a normal flow if there is no CSS.

### 2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
- A block-level element always starts on a new line.

- An inline element does not start on a new line.
- An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

### 3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
Static.

### 4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
- They can be over lapped with other elements.
- An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow.
- It sits on its own layer separate from everything else.

### 5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
Fixed is reletive to the viewport. Absolute is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.


## Learn JS
## Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

### 1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
To decare a fucntion is to give it a name. Invocation is to 'call' or activte it in some way.

### 2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

### 1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
1. Job Interview readiness. For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and communication skills are as, if not or more important, to a company than specific skills. Pair programming strengthens those skills.
2. Work environment readiness. Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from Coding/development programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works would have a great advantage at a new job.
