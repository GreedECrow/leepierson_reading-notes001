# CSS Layout

## Learn CSS - Flexbox

### 1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
It excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

### 2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
Main axis is the row/horizontal, cross axis is the column/vertical.

### 3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.



## CSS Layout - Flexbox

### 1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
It can do things like wrap text around an image.

### 2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
Personaly not sure, other than it's always useful to know and be able to use. I can't think of any reason to use it unless you want a website to run on wildly different screen sizes/aspect ratios, or a page for a picture gallery where many of the photos are likely to be extremely varied in size.

It's not something I'd like to use on any main pages. I prefer a less chaotic style if I'm looking for information.
