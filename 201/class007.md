# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

### 1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
It can take/track a lot of information and output it into something easy to follow.

## HTML Table Basics

### 1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
- Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users.
- Tables produce tag soup.
- Tables are not automatically responsive.

### 2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
- `<th>` Table Header
- `<tr>` Table Row
- `<td>` Table Data

## Introducing Constructors

### 1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
It acts like a template of object literals so if you add/remove/change the constructor, it will effect all the objects instead of having to do them one at a time.

### 2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
Honestly don't know. Couldn't figure out if there was a difference.


## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
