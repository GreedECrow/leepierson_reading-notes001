# Readings: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box ModelLearn HTML


## HTML
## Ordered and Unordered lists.

### 1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
When the order if the list items are not important.

### 2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
`list-style-type`.

### 3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
When the order of the list is important.

### 4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
`list-style-type` and `type`.


## Learn CSS
## The Box Model.

### 1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

### 2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent


## Learn JS
## Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

### 1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?
Variables, string, numbers and more than I can think of.

### 2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
I can't figure this one out.


### 3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
1. `x -= f()` Subtraction.
2. `x += f()` Addition.
3. `x /= f()` Division.
4. `x *= f()` Multiplication.
5. `x = f()` Assignment.

### 4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
No idea. If it was all number I think I could get it but I don't think I understand the question.

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

### 5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
If the number is higher than 5, you win. If it's lower, roll again.

### 6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
A contacts list. Starting with one letter, the loop will search intil it only shows names containing that letter. You keep adding letters until the loop has shortened the list enough to find what you are looking for.
