# Debugging

## Reading

### 1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
- Syntax errors are spelling error in the code.
- Logic errors are where the spelling and syntax are correct and is running but the code itself isn't doing what you intended. 

### 2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
- Used a full stop where I shouldn't have.
- Didn't a full stop where I should have.
- Capitol letters in the right and wrong places.
- Not knowing how to code at all.

I have been able to work through most of these by either reading it a 100 times or more very carefully, asking someone else to read it a 100 times or more very carefully or asking a TA what the answer is. Some times I try to google an answer but that is a damned minefield. 10 or more different answers to the same question and none of them use code I've seen before. I don't like to use it without understanding how it works.

### 3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
It's all a learning experience and the curve is steep. So many mistakes are just silly miskeys here and there but I do feel like there is a large understanding that I am missing for now.


## The JavaScript Debugger.

### 1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
JavaScript debugger allows you to see your code and break it up into sections to better see which part works and help to spot problem areas.

### 2. Define what a breakpoint is.
A break point is where the code will run up to/pause. Breaking up the code can help identify the problem areas without having to run the entire code everytime you want to test something.

### 3. What is the call stack?
The Call stack section shows you what code was executed.
