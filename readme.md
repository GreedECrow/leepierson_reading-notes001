# Leaning Markdown.
Hello everyone. I'm here to learn a new skill in something I enjoy so I can get a job I can enjoy. I look forward to learning with you all.

## Growth Mindset
A growth midset is whatever you need it to be to keep you moving forward no matter how many set backs.
### Things to remember
- If you learn from a set back, that is a step forward.
- Failure is a better teacher than success
- It's possible to make all the right moves and still lose. That's not failure, that's life.
- Don't stress the big things. Big things are big for a reason. They are complicated and difficult and time consuming. Be proud you tried the big things. Stress the little things. The little things are easy, ignoring the little things pile up until they are big things. If you deal with all the little things quickly while you can you have more time to deal with the big things. I think that makes sense.
- Above all else, DON'T PANIC.
